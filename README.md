# Instructions

Prior to opening any of the files, please download rideshare_kaggle.csv at https://www.kaggle.com/brllrb/uber-and-lyft-dataset-boston-ma. Ensure that this file is saved as "rideshare_kaggle.csv" in one of your local directories. Within the chunk of code for reading in the dataset, there is a line of code called setwd(). Make sure to copy and paste the directory that the data is saved into setwd(). While this line of code runs, the working directory will temporarily be set to where you saved the data so you can read in the csv file. Note that this was our only option as rideshare_kaggle.csv is too big for GoogleDrive and Github. These instructions are also repeated in each of the Rmd files. 


You will find 5 files (all of which have been knitted too). The files should be opened in the following order:

1. "Description.Rmd": gives a description of our project, including overview and motivation, related work, initial questions, data, and exploratory analysis. 

2. "HypothesisTesting.Rmd": Analysis done by Natalie Gomas

3. "Geospatial.Rmd": Analysis done by Allison newman

4. "" done by Val Carducci and Elea Bach

5. "" done by Natali Sorajja


You can also check out the knit html files that go by the same names! Have fun exploring!
